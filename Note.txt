
.I had used stm32L053C8
.Here, i had taken  100 samples from mpu 6050,every 10 ms.But i didn't wrote the further code for specific application with the processed data
.Here i used HAL Libraries with the help of STM CubeMX
.For sampling the data every 10 milli sec, i here just used only the HAL_Delay function.I had also done it with using timer interrupt

Reasons if the device may not be working with the controller(As given as task2):
I2C Address of the device may not be correct
Selected Bus speed may not be suitable for the selected device
Issues in voltage levels
bus capacitance and wrong pull ups(only occurs due to manufactural errors)
